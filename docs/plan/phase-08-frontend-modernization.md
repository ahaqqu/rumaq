# Phase 08 — Frontend Modernization

**Status:** Partial (Tailwind v4 + Kumo, TanStack Router/Query, PWA shell, and optimistic mutations for stock/plans/settings landed in earlier PRs; remaining work is legacy-CSS cleanup, error boundaries, offline fallback, runtime API caching, and deferred push/native decisions)  
**Priority:** P1/P2  
**Source sections:** Section 2 of `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`  
**Estimated effort:** Medium-High (mostly finish-work now that the big migration is in place)

---

## Objective

Finish modernizing the frontend architecture for performance, maintainability, and offline-capable mobile use. The heavy lifting — Tailwind v4 + Kumo, TanStack Router, TanStack Query with IDB persistence, and a PWA shell — is already in place. This phase completes the migration: remove the remaining legacy CSS, add proper error boundaries and loading states, harden the offline experience, and document decisions on push notifications and native wrappers. The user impact is: _a fast, app-like experience that works even with a flaky connection_.

This phase remains intentionally after P0. It is a large refactor that should not block the MVP.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Legacy CSS files (`frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`, `base.css`, `components.css`) are removed and all styling is expressed through Tailwind v4 + Kumo design tokens.
2. Kumo tokens are mapped to Tailwind theme extensions or CSS custom properties defined in `frontend/src/styles.css`, with no duplication.
3. Route-level `pendingComponent` and `errorComponent` are defined on all routes; a global error boundary protects the app root.
4. TanStack Query mutation hooks for locations and stores use optimistic updates, matching the `stock.js`/`plans.js` pattern.
5. The app has a real offline fallback page (`frontend/offline.html`) and the service worker is configured to serve it.
6. The service worker runtime-caches read API responses (`/api/stock`, `/api/plans`, `/api/purchases`) with a `NetworkFirst` strategy and a short TTL; write endpoints and AI endpoints are not cached.
7. The PWA manifest is enhanced with `scope`, `id`, a maskable icon, and recommended categories/screenshots.
8. Push notifications for expiry/run-out reminders are either implemented end-to-end or explicitly deferred with a documented decision.
9. A documented decision on mobile native wrappers (Capacitor vs. alternatives) is added to the project docs.
10. All existing tests pass and `./scripts/test.sh unit frontend` passes.
11. `./scripts/test.sh unit frontend` and `./scripts/test.sh automation-local frontend` pass (use `scripts/test.sh`; do not rely on `vp` aliases that may differ per environment).

## Dependencies

- Phases 01-05 for the backend endpoints the frontend consumes.
- Existing `frontend/src/styles.css`, `frontend/src/routeTree.gen.ts`, `frontend/src/routes/`.
- Existing TanStack Query hooks in `frontend/src/lib/queries/`.
- Existing `vite-plugin-pwa` setup in `frontend/vite.config.js`.
- Existing Kumo design tokens and persona system.

---

## Scope

### 1. Tailwind v4 + Kumo theme cleanup

- Keep `frontend/src/styles.css` using Tailwind v4 `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax.
- Map Kumo tokens to Tailwind theme extensions via the `@theme` block (colors, spacing, typography, radii, shadows). Avoid duplicating the same values as standalone CSS custom properties in both `tokens.css` and `styles.css`.
- Migrate, then delete legacy files:
  - `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`
  - `frontend/src/styles/base.css`
  - `frontend/src/styles/components.css`
- Replace custom component class names (e.g., `.btn`, `.card`, `.rail`) with Tailwind utilities incrementally. Pilot on the Settings page, then move page by page.
- Preserve motion preferences (`none`, `reduced`, `standard`) using Tailwind `motion-safe` and `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### 2. TanStack Router finish work

- File-based routing is already used; keep it.
- Add `loader` to routes where data should be fetched before render (e.g., `/inventory`, `/plan`, `/history`).
- Add `pendingComponent` and `pendingMs`/`pendingMinMs` to each route for skeleton UX.
- Add `errorComponent` to each route that surfaces a friendly fallback and a retry action.
- Use `getRouteApi` to consume loader data without circular imports.
- Pass `AbortSignal` to `fetch` in loaders so requests cancel on navigation.

### 3. TanStack Query adoption finish work

- Query keys for each resource type already exist: `['settings']`, `['stock']`, `['plans']`, `['purchases']`, `['locations']`, `['stores']`, `['usage']`.
- Add optimistic updates for:
  - `createLocation` / `deleteLocation` — update the `['locations']` cache immediately, roll back on error.
  - `createStore` / `deleteStore` — update the `['stores']` cache immediately, roll back on error.
- Keep `queryClient.invalidateQueries` for background refetch after mutations where optimistic updates are not enough.
- Add a global loading indicator driven by TanStack Query's `isFetching` if one is not already present.
- Keep the `PersistQueryClientProvider` + IDB persister configuration; it is the correct offline-read foundation.

### 4. PWA manifest and service worker hardening

- Keep `vite-plugin-pwa` as the PWA engine. Do not add a standalone source `manifest.json`; let the plugin generate it from `vite.config.js`.
- Enhance the inline manifest:
  - Add `id: '/'` for stable install behavior.
  - Add `scope: '/'`.
  - Add a maskable icon variant.
  - Add `categories` and `screenshots` if assets are available.
  - Keep `display: 'standalone'`, `start_url: '/'`, theme/background colors.
- Add `frontend/offline.html` as a real offline fallback page (not just `index.html`).
- Update the `VitePWA` `workbox` configuration:
  - Keep precaching for js/css/html/ico/png/svg/woff2.
  - Configure `navigateFallback` to `/offline.html` with a denylist that excludes `/offline.html` itself and API routes.
  - Add `runtimeCaching` for `/api/stock`, `/api/plans`, `/api/purchases` using `NetworkFirst` with a short TTL (e.g., 5 minutes) and a small cache limit. Exclude `/api/settings` and AI endpoints.
- Register the service worker via the existing `PwaUpdatePrompt.jsx` pattern.
- Keep the update-prompt UX that asks the user before activating a new SW.

### 5. Offline / optimistic updates

- Keep the existing `useOnlineStatus` hook and `OfflineBanner` component.
- Convert `OfflineBanner` styling from inline legacy-CSS-variable styles to Tailwind utilities.
- Ensure cached reads work after a service-worker-controlled reload.
- For MVP, focus on read-only offline experience and optimistic UI for mutations when online. Advanced queued writes are future work.

### 6. Push notifications

- This is P2 and may be deferred. If implemented:
  - Implement Web Push in the service worker.
  - Backend: add `POST /api/push/subscribe` to store push subscriptions in D1 (table schema below).
  - Backend: add a scheduled Worker trigger (Cron Trigger) that checks for expiring/running-out items and sends push notifications.
  - Ask user permission only after an explicit opt-in gesture (e.g., a toggle in Settings).
  - Send notifications for items expiring in 2 days and items running out in 1 day.
  - Generate and store VAPID keys as Worker secrets (`VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`).
- If deferred, create a separate follow-up document that records the decision, iOS limitations, and the recommended VAPID/self-hosted approach.

### 7. Mobile native wrappers

- Evaluate Capacitor vs. Tauri vs. React Native vs. Cordova.
- Document the decision in `docs/MOBILE_WRAPPERS_DECISION.md` (or equivalent).
- Recommendation for this project: **Capacitor** if a native store wrapper is ever needed, because it is the modern web-first wrapper with the strongest plugin ecosystem. **Tauri** only if desktop + mobile + tiny binary/Rust native code is desired. **React Native** only if a fully native UI is required and the team accepts a separate component model. **Cordova** should be avoided for new work.
- For P2/MVP, keep focusing on the PWA install flow; native wrappers are future work.

### 8. Error boundaries and loading states

- Add a global error boundary around the app root (e.g., `react-error-boundary` or TanStack Router's default boundary).
- Add route-level `errorComponent` fallbacks using the existing persona copy for friendly messaging.
- Add route-level `pendingComponent` skeletons using the existing `SkeletonRows` component.
- Migrate imperative `isLoading`/`isFetching` checks to declarative Suspense-style boundaries where practical.

---

## Out of Scope

- Complete rewrite of the UI design (keep Kumo design).
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for Cloudflare Pages.
- React Native app.
- Real-time synchronization across devices (TanStack Query refetch is enough for MVP).
- Advanced background sync / queued mutations for offline writes (basic offline read is enough for MVP).

---

## Database Changes

If push notifications are implemented, add:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS push_subscriptions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  endpoint TEXT NOT NULL,
  p256dh TEXT NOT NULL,
  auth TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  UNIQUE (user_id, endpoint)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_push_subscriptions_user ON push_subscriptions(user_id);
```

No other schema changes are expected for this phase.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit tests

1. Update existing tests to work with route-level `pendingComponent`/`errorComponent` where added.
2. Add tests for the new optimistic update hooks (`locations`, `stores`).
3. Add tests for the offline fallback page and service worker runtime caching if feasible.
4. Keep the existing `virtual:pwa-register/react` mock so `PwaUpdatePrompt` tests do not regress.

### E2E tests

1. Test PWA installability using Playwright or Lighthouse.
2. Test the offline fallback page by disabling network in Playwright.
3. Test optimistic updates feel instant and roll back on forced failures.
4. Test push notification subscription flow only if implemented; otherwise skip.

### Manual verification

1. Run the app and verify all pages load.
2. Verify the app is installable in Chrome/Edge DevTools.
3. Test offline mode by disconnecting network and reloading.
4. Verify optimistic updates feel instant.
5. Verify motion preferences still work after legacy CSS removal.

## Deployment & Secrets

- If push notifications are implemented, generate VAPID keys and store them as Worker secrets (`VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`).
- The PWA manifest and service worker are built into static assets by `vite-plugin-pwa`; no backend changes are needed except for push subscriptions if implemented.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                                             | Impact | Mitigation                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Legacy CSS removal breaks existing styling                       | High   | Migrate incrementally page by page; keep tests passing; compare screenshots.       |
| TanStack Query cache gets stale or inconsistent                  | Medium | Use proper query keys and invalidation; write tests for mutations.                 |
| Service worker caches stale API responses                        | Medium | Use `NetworkFirst` + short TTL; keep AI endpoints and settings out of the cache.     |
| Route-level error boundaries hide useful debug info in dev       | Low    | Use different components for dev (show stack) and prod (friendly fallback).          |
| Push notifications require complex setup and may not work on iOS | Medium | Defer to P2; test on Android first; document iOS limitations.                      |
| Offline mutation queue is complex                                | Medium | For MVP, only cache reads; defer write queue to later.                             |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should the offline fallback page be a separate HTML file or a route in the SPA?** Recommendation: separate `offline.html` so the service worker can serve it even before the SPA bundle is available.
2. **Should we cache `/api/settings` in the service worker?** Recommendation: no. Settings can change the app's behavior; always fetch fresh and rely on TanStack Query persistence for offline reads instead.
3. **Should we migrate all remaining custom classes at once or incrementally?** Recommendation: incrementally, one page per PR, to keep diffs reviewable.
4. **Should push notifications be implemented in this phase or deferred?** Recommendation: defer to a follow-up unless P2 scope is explicitly approved; the subscription backend can be built quickly, but scheduling, VAPID secrets, and iOS edge cases take time.
5. **Should native wrappers be Capacitor or something else?** Recommendation: Capacitor if needed, but PWA install is the priority for MVP.

---

## Alternatives Considered

- **Keep the existing hybrid CSS (Tailwind + custom components):** Rejected because two competing style systems increase maintenance cost and dilute the Kumo design language.
- **Keep the existing imperative loading states instead of route boundaries:** Rejected because route-level `pendingComponent`/`errorComponent` gives better UX and simpler page components.
- **Use Redux for state:** Rejected; TanStack Query handles server state and React Context handles client state, which is enough.
- **Build a native app first instead of PWA:** Rejected because PWA is faster to ship and covers most users.
- **Use Next.js or Remix instead of Vite + TanStack Router:** Rejected because the project is already on Vite and static Pages hosting is simpler.
- **Add a source `manifest.json` instead of letting `vite-plugin-pwa` generate it:** Rejected because the plugin already generates a correct manifest and a source file adds a second source of truth.

---

## Implementation Notes for a Future Session

1. Audit current component styles to identify all usages of legacy custom classes.
2. Migrate the Settings page to pure Tailwind + Kumo first as the pilot.
3. Add `offline.html` and update `vite-plugin-pwa` Workbox config.
4. Add route-level `pendingComponent` and `errorComponent`.
5. Add optimistic updates to `locations.js` and `stores.js`.
6. Add runtime API caching to the service worker.
7. (Optional, deferred) Implement push notifications or create a separate design document.
8. (Optional, deferred) Document native wrapper decision.
9. Run the full test suite and open one or more PRs.

After this phase, the frontend is modern, fast, and feels like a native app with offline support.
