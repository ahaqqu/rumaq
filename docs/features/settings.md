# Settings

The settings page manages AI provider configuration, persona personalisation, storage locations, recorded stores, and display preferences.

## What it changes

- **AI key** — set or change an API key for one of four providers (OpenCode, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
- **Provider selector** — choose which AI backend to use
- **Test connection** — validate the API key before saving
- **Usage meter** — shows current AI usage against daily limits
- **Persona** — define user role and AI role for personalised tone, with AI-generated copy
- **Locations** — manage storage locations (Kulkas, Freezer, etc.) used in inventory
- **Stores** — manage store names used in purchases and plans
- **Display** — motion preference (none/reduced/standard) and language (English/Indonesian)

## How it works

1. Settings are fetched via `useSettings()` on mount (`GET /api/settings`)
2. AI key is stored as a password field; `has_ai_key` boolean indicates whether one is set (the actual key is never returned)
3. Test calls `testAiKey(provider, key)` which sends a minimal prompt to the selected provider
4. Persona roles are saved via `PATCH /api/settings`; if AI key is present, `regenerateCopy()` rewrites all app copy
5. Locations and stores are CRUD-managed through their respective endpoints
6. Language changes via i18n and persists to settings
7. Motion preference controls CSS animation levels across the app
